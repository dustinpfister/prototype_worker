# Worker Module

This is a prototype for a worker module that is used to create a Worker Class instance that repersents someone that is working for a living. A worker class instance has a value called effort that is a value that can be used to determin how valubule a worker is to a company. How much a worker is getting payed, and how happy they are effect thire effort at the job. I made this prototype to help draft togather some ideas for a future game that may or may not happen.
